## Synopsis

This project is the Discount Ascii Warehouse iOS application being created as part of the X-Team iOS Exam. The project pulls NDJSON from a server, parses it, and displays viewable products to the user in a collection view. Users can add products to their cart and make a fictitious purchase or share the products with their friends with facebook.

## Installation

The app can pulled from Github and simulated in Xcode on iPhone devices running >= iOS 8.0 in portrait mode. I built the app without the use of 3rd Party Libraries so there aren't any additional dependencies to worry about.
